# Path-Planner
This project involves having an overhead image of a certain area. 
- A TensorFlow based object detection algorithm detects obstacles and creates a map. 
- A* algorithm based path planner finds the shortest path from start to end, while successfully avoiding obstacles.
The first prototype is based on a basic ESP-32 based robot car, with a webcam providing the overhead image for mapping.
